# Customer Segmentation Project
The Mall Customer Segmentation project! This project aims to analyze customer data from a mall and segment customers using machine learning techniques. By understanding different customer segments, malls and retailers can tailor their marketing strategies and services more effectively
## Project Overview
**Objective**: To segment mall customers based on their annual Income and spending behavior.
**Algorithm**: K-Means clustering
**Programming Language**: Python
**Libraries Used**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about mall customers, including:

**CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
**Gender**: Gender of the customer
**Age**: Age of the customer
**Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
**Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior
## Methodology
**Data Collection**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and standardizing the data.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
**K-means Clustering**: Implementing the K-means algorithm to segment customers into different clusters.
**Evaluation*: Analyzed the clusters and interpret the results.

## Conclusion:

In this project, I implemented K-means clustering to segment mall customers based on their demographic and spending behavior. Through detailed exploratory data analysis and careful preprocessing, I identified distinct customer segments that can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

The results demonstrate the power of machine learning in uncovering patterns within customer data, enabling businesses to enhance their understanding of customer needs and preferences. By leveraging these insights, malls and retailers can optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive business growth.

This project serves as a foundational example of how data science techniques can be applied to real-world business problems. Future work could explore more advanced clustering algorithms, incorporate additional features, or apply these methods to other domains to further refine and expand the scope of customer segmentation.
